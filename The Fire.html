	<ul><h4>The Bible describes God to us as a consuming fire, a jealous God, and He yearns jealously over the spirit that He has made to dwell in us. God is like a consuming fire not to make Him fearful to keep us away but to purify us out of His love to build His kingdom that cannot be shaken. So, how do we accommodate the loving consuming fire to be built into His unshaken kingdom?</h4></ul>

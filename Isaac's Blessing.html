	<ul><h4>To make a promise is one thing, to keep it is another. If a person made a promise to us, then we could only hope for the best because we have no way to ensure his promise. However, if God made a promise then we are sure it's golden. Not only that, but God also made it as a covenant. That's what happened to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their offspring, Israelites as long as they obey God. The question is how could God know that they would keep their end of the bargain? As for us, the gentiles who are saved by grace, how do we know that God's promises also applied to us?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Even though we are saved, we are still living in this world. We still could encounter dangers, challenges, temptations, etc. as before. Could we handle those kinds of things better than before? Abraham also had the same experiences. He had faith and was the friend of God. Yet when he faced danger he still did what we would do. Was he lacking faith? Was it okay for us to take the easy way out like him? What could we learn from Abraham's real life experience?</h4></ul>

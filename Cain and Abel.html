	<ul><h3>2. Cain and Abel (Genesis 4: 3 - 8)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>I once saw a coffee shop named Cain and Abel next to the University of Texas campus. I guess that's how familiar people are with that Bible story. If the atrocity of killing like that could happen in a family, then it's no surprise that so many horrible things could happen in the world nowadays. So, how do we learn from the story and prepare ourselves to face the world?</h4></ul>

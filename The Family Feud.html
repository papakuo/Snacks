	<ul><h3>20. The Family Feud (Genesis 27: 6 - 10)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>It's nothing new to have a family dispute. We all have been there. However, for the Abraham clan, it's a family feud. Sometimes, it was so intense, one member or members wanted to put the other family member to death. Why did God allow that to happen? Could it happen in our own family? Shouldn't God bring us peace instead of chaos? What kind of message does God want us to learn?</h4></ul>

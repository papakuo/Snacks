	<ul><h3>33. Esau's Descendants (Genesis 36: 1 - 5)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God blessed Isaac because he was from Abraham's wife Sarah. Yet God also blessed Ishmael who was from Abraham's other wife Hagar. The same happened to Jacob and Esau. Even though God chose Jacob at first, he blessed Esau to be a big tribe too. This is like why God blessed us, the saved gentile, the same as Israelites, the chosen people. So, why was that? How could we live a life worth the blessing?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h4>A successful person knows how to put other people's money into his own pocket and put his own thoughts into other people's heads. As a matter of fact, the latter is harder. Even though it could be successful at first, it might not last long because people have their own knowledge of good and evil, and they always think that they are good and right. Then how would we be able to believe in God? What could God do to change our strong will?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God made the covenant with Israelites to follow His laws. However, they didn't continue on their part. So, God showed no concern for them and made a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. Unlike the old covenant that they just followed what the laws said. The new covenant that God puts the laws in their minds for them to know God with their hearts understanding the laws. Because of Christ, we are part of the house of Judah. So, do we know how to understand the laws to know God?</h4></ul>

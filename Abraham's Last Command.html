	<ul><h4>We all hope that we could live longer. If not, then at least we hope to pass down our wishes that one day they could be fulfilled. Abraham was no exception. He made his last wish as a command for his servant to obey. Why was he so sincere? Didn't God promise him all those blessings already? What could he do to ensure those blessings even more? What could we learn from Abraham about the true meaning of life?</h4></ul>

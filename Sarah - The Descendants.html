	<ul><h4>Faith is available to people who are willing to submit themselves to God. When we talked about faith, we often thought of Abraham. The pressure was on Sarah too because she needed to endure the same trials as Abraham's wife.

Or, because of her submission that God promised her to conceive?</h4></ul>

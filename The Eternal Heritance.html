	<ul><h3>16. The Eternal Heritance (Hebrews 9: 15 - 22)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. This is promised by God and fulfilled like a will after the death of Jesus Christ for our sins. Indeed, by receiving Christ as a savior, we inherited the will, the eternal life. The purpose of eternal life is to live with God. So, do we have the assurance for eternal heritance now?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h4>To forgive is one thing, to forget is another. So, the debts of our sins are not only paid by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, but also covered by his blood and forgotten. That's how we could be sanctified and perfected to God. Yet our flesh still allowed the devil to remind us of our transgressions. So, we still lived under the accusations of our conscience. We even tried to use our own ways to make peace with our conscience. So, how could we feel that we are truly sanctified and perfected by a single offering of Jesus Christ?</h4></ul>

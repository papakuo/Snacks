	<ul><h4>Welcome to the snacks for thought land. As the name suggested, each article is just a brief taste of a Bible subject. It's by no means to provide a full course of the subject. The purpose is to bring up your appetite to read more about the Bible. I used to email my family members these snacks for thought articles. Well, some of them like the ideas. So, hopefully, some of you would feel the same.

It's a work in progress. For a starter, it covers just two books of the Bible, Genesis and Hebrews. Hopefully, God permits, more will be added later. Emmanuel. Bon app√©tit. </h4></ul>

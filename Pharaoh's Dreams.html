	<ul><h4>People say that if it doesn't kill you, builds you characters. This may not be true unless it's from God. This is what had happened to Joseph. After a few ups and downs, his life finally reached maturity. When he interpreted Pharaoh's dream, he didn't just provide answers, he also provided solutions. The result was that his whole life got turned around. After being saved, we also have the Holy Spirit from God as our mediator and comforter. So, how do we let the Holy Spirit turn our life around too?</h4></ul>

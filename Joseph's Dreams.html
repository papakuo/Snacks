	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Joseph didn't get along well with his brothers. The two dreams he had made the situation even worse. After hearing in his dreams, the whole family would bow down to Joseph, his brother decided to kill him. Instead of being killed, he was forced to exile from the family for 22 years. In those years, he became the prime minister of Egypt. He also achieved wisdom to solve strange dreams, maybe his own too. That's probably why he moved Jacob's whole household to Egypt. After being saved, do we have the wisdom to understand God's will better?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>36. Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38: 13 - 18)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>The four women listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ all had something in common. They all had desperate experiences in life. They all cared about the inheritance. They all received a second chance through God's mercy. This is especially true for Tamar. We might judge her because of what she had done. After being saved, we realize that we are just like her who are saved by grace. So, how do we learn to be humble so that we can see grace instead of self-righteousness?</h4></ul>

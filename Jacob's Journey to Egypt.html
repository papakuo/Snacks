	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>When God called Abraham out of Ur to enter the promised land Canaan, we might wonder what's so special about Canaan? Now, after Joseph became the ruler of Egypt, God called Jacob to enter Egypt. We may wonder why the move again? If we understand God's righteousness and love, then we will be amazed that God never ceased to build Israelites into a peculiar nation according to His will to receive more blessings. The same thing happens to the church of Christ. So, as a member of the church, how do we learn what to do to receive the rewards?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>21. Jacob's Dream (Genesis 28: 12 -19)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>As described in the Bible, God used to deliver His messages through dreams. We learned God's messages from people who received the dreams loud and clear. This also made those people a legend, such as Jacob, etc. Of course, there were many false dreams which were proven wrong afterward. In addition to dreams, we also heard that people spoke in tongues and claimed to be from God. So, how do we ascertain that? Or, what's the true means for us to receive God's words?</h4></ul>

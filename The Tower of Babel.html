	<ul><h3>7. The Tower of Babel (Genesis 11: 4 - 7)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>

If it's not a foreseeable building then it's the wealth, power, reputation, etc. In other words, something to make a name for ourselves. Because there is a Tower of Babel in everybody's mind. Is it really worthwhile? If it's not then what should we do?</h4></ul>

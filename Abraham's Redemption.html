	<ul><h3>16. Abraham's Redemption (Genesis 22: 1 - 2)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Moses told Israelites to keep God's statutes and commandments so that they and their children might go well and prolong their days in the land promised by God. It seems that God was asking Israelites to return a favor by obeying Him and His laws. When God asked Abraham to offer Isaac, it seems that God was asking Abraham to return a favor too. Yet without questioning, Abraham obeyed. Then instead of losing Isaac, Abraham was redeemed by experiencing God's abundant mercy and love. So, how do we learn to obey God not for God's sake but for our own good?</h4></ul>

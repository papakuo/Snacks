	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>I once heard a story about a preacher inviting a person to church. The person refused by saying that he wouldn't go because the church was full of hypocrites. The preacher replied that he was right indeed. However, there's always room for one more. Even though being saved, we are still no better than unsaved people, sometimes even worse. This is just like Jacob's twelve sons. They all had issues in or among them. Yet, God determined to build the Israel nation from them. So, how do we expect God to build his Church or even more from us? How should we prepare ourselves?</h4></ul>

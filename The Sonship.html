	<ul><h3>15. The Sonship (Genesis 21: 8 - 13)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God blessed Ismael because he was Abraham's offspring. Yet he was not entitled to Abraham's heritage. We are saved by accepting Christ as our savior. Yet like Ismael, we may be blessed but we still couldn't entitle the entire heritage because we still lived in the old self that was a slave of the flesh. To entitle the heritage, we need to have the sonship. To have the sonship, we need to be born again. So, how could we be born again to have a sonship?</h4></ul>

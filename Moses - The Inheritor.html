	<ul><h3>28. Moses - The Inheritor (Hebrews 11: 23 - 29)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Moses, Man of God, who had accomplished amazing tasks. He led Israelites out of Egypt after performing the ten plagues, departed the Red Sea, wrote the Ten Commandments, led over a million Israelites wandering in the desert for forty years. Yet, he describes life as but toil and trouble, soon fly away. Was it because God said that he shall not bring the assembly into Canaan? Or, was it because he realized that he just finished the tasks as an inheritor in God's eternal will?</h4></ul>

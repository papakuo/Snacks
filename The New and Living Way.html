	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Christ died for our sins and freed us from all sins. So, we should feel sanctified and perfected. Yet, our conscience would tell us otherwise. The conscience tells us right from wrong which is based on our old flesh, the deceitful knowledge of good and evil. It's a sin. So, even though we are saved, we are still bound by the sin to feel sinful. So, what should we do to be freed from the old flesh and live a new and living way?</h4></ul>

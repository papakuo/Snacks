	<ul><h4>There are many things in the Bible that are copies of the heavenly things, such as the holy temple itself and things it employed. For the worldly copies and covenants, they all need to be purified by blood. That's why Christ needed to shed his blood as a sacrifice, because only his blood could have such profound power to fulfill God's righteousness and holiness for good. After being saved, do we sense that our lives are copies of the heavenly things too? If so, then how?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>We might think what Simeon and Levi did to Shechem and the men in the city was extremely cruel. Just because Shechem defied their sister Dinah, they killed not only Shechem but also all the males in the city. Even Jacob later criticized their violence. Levi's sons were also very violent. They killed many Israelites as God commanded because they worshiped the golden calf. Yet, God took the Levites to be His to serve Him alone. If we want to serve God, then what could we learn from the Levites?</h4></ul>

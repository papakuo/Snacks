	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Does God need a man as his friend? Yet God called Abraham His friend. So, how to be God's friend? What could a man do to help God? The same question could apply to us. The Bible says that Christ Jesus called us his brothers. It's even closer than being his friends. So, what does that mean? Could we learn from Abraham how to be Christ's brothers?</h4></ul>

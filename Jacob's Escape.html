	<ul><h4>We often heard that to prevail, you need to be aggressive. No doubt, Rachel was very aggressive. Not only that she tried everything to get conceived, but she also stole her father Laban's household gods when Jacob was trying to escape from Laban. Even though that put the family and herself in danger, yet her aggressiveness probably encouraged Jacob and the family to face the hostile situations on their homecoming. Today, after being saved, we no longer rely on our own aggressiveness but faith. So, how do we transform our aggressiveness from flesh to faith in the spirit?</h4></ul>

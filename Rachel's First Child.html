	<ul><h3>24. Rachel's First Child (Genesis 30: 22 - 28)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>We don't like to wait. Waiting without knowing if there is any outcome probably is the worst for us to endure. Abraham waited for 25 years before Isaac was born. At least he knew that he would get an offspring because that's what God had promised. As for Rachel, her waiting was even worse because nobody could give her any promise to have a child. Especially after seeing Jacob's other wives had conceived several sons already. Eventually, she conceived a son, Joseph, who later saved Jacob's whole household. So, Is there any means that could help us to endure waiting?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>4. The High Priest (Hebrews 2: 14 - 18)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God gave Israelis His laws for them to obey. They committed sins if they didn't obey. So, they needed to offer a sacrifice for the High Priest to redeem their sins. Then Jesus came. The Bible reveals that he was the lamb that was offered as the sacrifice by himself as the High Priest to redeem our sins once for all. This is even more true after the destruction of the Holy temple. So, do we know how to accept the truth and let the High Priest not only save us but also keep helping us in life?</h4></ul>

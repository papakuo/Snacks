	<ul><h4>Adam and Eve disobeyed God's command and ate the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that they could be like God. The Bible told us that God made man for a little while lower than the angels; have crowned man with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet. It's as close as what God did to Adam and Eve. Yet, they failed. So, how do we know it could become a reality for us and we won't fail?</h4></ul>

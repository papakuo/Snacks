	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>It's hard to imagine being sinless like Jesus. Indeed, Jesus was born in the sinner's form but never sinned. If we take a look on Joseph's life then we could see a closed image of Jesus Christ. Joseph was put in a difficult or even hostile environment like Jesus. He faced numerous trials and temptations like Jesus. He showed amazing wisdom that could only come from God like Jesus. He provided salvations to people like Jesus. The most important thing is that he didn't commit mortal sins like Jesus. What were his secrets? Could we be better than him with Christ as our savior?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>The Bible starts with Genesis and ends with Revelation. It describes a lot of things between men and God. It all started after God created the Garden of Eden. So, to understand the meaning of men and God, we need to start with Genesis. Also, the more we learn about the Bible, the more we will prevail in life.</h4></ul>

	<ul><h4>As described in the Bible, the tabernacle as well as holy temples have two sections. The priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties. Only the high priest goes into the second section once a year to redeem sins with blood. So, do we know that our spiritual value is focused on the ritual duties, or the righteousness and holiness of God? If it's the latter then how do we know we could be godly?</h4></ul>

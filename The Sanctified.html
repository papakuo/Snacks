	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>We know that to forgive sins, we need to pay a price. That's why Israelis offered sacrifices to redeem their sins. Then Jesus Christ came and sacrificed himself to redeem our sins once for all so that we could be sanctified for good. This salvation is even more true since the holy temple is no more. Yet why do we still feel the emptiness? Why are we still tempted by the world to commit sins? How could we get the assurance for the sanctification? </h4></ul>

	<ul><h4>What's the most necessary thing in life? We may have our own definitions. In the Bible, Jesus said to Martha that one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her. After being saved, God gave us faith expecting us to be like Mary to devote to Christ, love Him and listen to Him. If we fulfill that, then we achieve the most necessary thing in life. Amen.</h4></ul>

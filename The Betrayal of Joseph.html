	<ul><h4>If life was not hard enough, then betrayal would make it worse. To be betrayed by one's own family would make it the worst. That's exactly what had happened to Joseph. The Bible didn't describe his emotion. However, that didn't mean he forgot. He just learned to cope with the difficulties without sacrificing his integrity. He didn't get defeated but grew wiser everyday. Jesus experienced the same betrayal and prevailed. So, how do we learn to cope with all of the odds and prevail like the children of God.</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>9. Abram's Earthly Offsoring (Genesis 13: 14 - 17)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God made several promises to Abraham. Why was that? Why didn't God make one big promise that included all of the promises instead? Didn't God know His plan for Abraham at the beginning? If we studied under what circumstance that God made each promise to Abraham, then we will know God's plan for the journey of faith. The more we understand the more we know about God's will and how to apply it to our spiritual growth.</h4></ul>

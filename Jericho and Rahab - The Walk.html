	<ul><h3>29. Jericho and Rahab - The Walk (Hebrews 11: 30 - 31)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>As described in the Bible, Israelites encircled the city of Jericho once a day for six days. On the seventh day, they circled the city seven times. Then they shouted a great shout together and the city wall was tumbled. How could that be? Also, how could a lowly Jericho prostitute Rehab survive such an ordeal? How could we learn from what had happened in Jericho and apply it to our spiritual life?</h4></ul>

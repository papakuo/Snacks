	<ul><h3>22. Jacob Meets Rachel (Genesis 29: 4 - 12)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Based on events recorded in the Bible, Jacob was at least over 70 when he met Rachel. So, Jacob should be very mature to control his feelings. Yet when he saw Rachel, he was so emotional like a teenager. One possibility was that after a long exhausting journey, Jacob was longing for a place to rest. So, when he saw Rachel by a well, his heart was suddenly disarmed. Because the well quenched his physical thirst as well as Rachel comforted his thirsty heart. The same thing happened to Moses. Don't even mention the Samaritan woman who met Jesus by Jacob's well. How could we have the same eye opening experience?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>We often hear that young people nowadays are reluctant to get married, and don't even mention having children. Especially in those Asian countries that used to focus on marriage and having children. It is because young people no longer want to bear the heavy burden. Also, they think the world is too corrupted and hostile to bring a child to this world. Yet God promised Abraham countless descendants. Not only that, but God also made a covenant with Abraham. In other words, God would help Abraham to fulfill the promise. So, how would the covenant help Abraham's faith? How would we learn from that to overcome the fear of having children?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>A person's name represents the person. That's why people are sincere in naming their children. However, could a person's name determine his fate? Joseph had two sons. He named them to represent the two stages of his life, the hardship and fruitfulness. However, when Jacob blessed them, he blessed the younger son, fruitfulness first then the older son, hardship. After being saved, do we know what our new identity is? How do we live up to the new name?</h4></ul>

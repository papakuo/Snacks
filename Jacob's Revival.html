	<ul><h3>47. Jacob's Revival (Genesis 45: 25 - 28)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>When Jacob first heard about Joseph's death, he didn't doubt it. Because in his heart, he knew how the brothers felt about Joseph. He also knew what his sons were capable of doing. So, when he thought that the worst had happened, he must be desperate that he didn't do anything to prevent the tragedy. So, when he heard that Joseph didn't die, his heart was revived. Because now he could assure God's promises to the family and Joseph. He finally made peace with God. Now, Christ is trying to trigger even a bigger revival in his church. So, do we know what that is and how to prepare for that?</h4></ul>

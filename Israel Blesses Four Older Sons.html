	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Ever since he thought that Joseph had died, Jacob seemed to lose touch with God. The Bible didn't record anything he said or did until he was told that Joseph was still alive. Yet in his final days, he could prophesy the future for all of his sons. Especially the prophecy of Messiah from Judah's descendants. So, even though he was quiet outwardly, his inner spirit kept growing. After being saved, we also could be inspired by the Holy Spirit. So, do we know how to understand and follow the Holy Spirit?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>29. Jacob Meets Esau (Genesis 33: 4 - 11)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Even though Esau lost his birthright to Jacob without much thought, yet when he knew that Jacob stole his blessing he was desperate and wanted to kill Jacob. So, it seemed that he did care. However, when he finally met with Jacob, it seemed that he was okay with what Jacob had done because he had enough already. Jacob on the contrary showed a sincere repentance by giving Esau a great fortune, called Esau his lord, and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother Esau. What could we learn from these two different attitudes?</h4></ul>

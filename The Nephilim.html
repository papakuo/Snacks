	<ul><h3>4. The Nephilim (Genesis 6: 4 - 8)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>We often referred to an uneven match as David against Goliath because David was a regular young man while Goliath was a giant at that time. Israelites also encountered those giants called Nephilim when they tried to enter Canaan. So, there is a good chance that Goliath was a Nephilim. We might not face a Nephilim in real life. However, in spiritual warfare, we could easily encounter a Nephilim like David. So, how do we prepare ourselves in case that happens?</h4></ul>

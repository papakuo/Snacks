	<ul><h3>46. Joseph's Reconcilation (Genesis 45: 1 - 5)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>After seeing his brothers transformed because of the wrongdoing they had done to him. Joseph finally reconciled with his brothers and wept aloud. It could be that his hardship was finally paid off just like God revealed in his dreams. Or it could be that he finally realized about God's will for the family. At any rate, it took him a painful journey to fulfill. To reconcile with Him, God is doing the same to those who are saved by his grace. So, do we know how to prepare ourselves for the spiritual journey?</h4></ul>

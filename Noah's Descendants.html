	<ul><h4>I once read an article called "We donâ€™t choose our parents, but our parents chose our fate". It describes how the parents treated the child that affected the child's life. It's so true for Noah's sons. Noah was drunk once. Depending on his son's reactions, he cursed Ham's descendants Canaan, and blessed the descendants of Shem and Japheth. History showed that's exactly what had happened. It's true even nowadays. So, is there a way to change that? If so, then how?</h4></ul>

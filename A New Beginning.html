	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>When Jacob died, Joseph ensured his brothers not to fear for what they had done because God meant it for good. Before Joseph's own death, he told his brothers that "God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." Now, that's faith. He never forgot what God had promised to the family in the covenants and reminded the family to look forward to the new beginning. God also made the covenant with us through Jesus Christ. Do we know what it is and how to look forward to it?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>27. Mahanaim (Genesis 32: 1 - 8)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God must have loved Jacob very much. When God promised to be with Jacob on his way back to Canaan, He sent not one but two camps of angels to meet with Jacob. Jacob indeed got the message. So, he named the place Mahanaim, two camps. That place became a holy place to Israelites later to synonymize God's grace and protection. Jacob was also inspired by the angels to divide his family into two groups before meeting with Esau. So, what could we learn from the angels like Jacob and apply to our own life?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h3>44. Joseph's Restoration (Genesis 43: 31 - 34)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>Joseph's success was no accident. Unlike most of us, he could not only see problems, but also provide solutions, like what he did for Pharaoh's dreams. He did the same for his own family. Even though what his brothers did was wrong, he tried to restore the family according to what God had shown in his dreams. As being saved, God also tried to restore us in Christ through the Holy Spirit. So, how do we know to follow the Holy Spirit?</h4></ul>

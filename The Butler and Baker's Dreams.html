	<ul><h4>God is righteous and Justice. So, He revealed His intentions to people both saved and unsaved. That's what happened to the dreams of Pharaoh's butler and baker. However, they still needed people like Joseph to interpret their dreams. Without Joseph, their dreams meant nothing. The same thing happened to Pharaoh's dream later. So, if there is no person to interpret God's intention, then God would not reveal His intention. Nowadays, we have the Bible that has more God's words than any dreams. So, who can interpret God's words for us?</h4></ul>

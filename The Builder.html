	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>God wanted to dwell with men who were created by Him. So, he built the garden of Eden. He commanded Moses to build the tabernacle. Even though men tried to build holy temples for God to dwell later, they all became the past. However, God never ceased the demand to dwell with men. Then Jesus Christ came to fulfill the demand. It also involved us in building God's dwelling place. So, do we know how to be part of the process?</h4></ul>

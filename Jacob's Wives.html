	<ul><h3>23. Jacob's Wives (Genesis 29: 16 - 24)</h3></ul>
	<ul><h3>The Starter</h3></ul>
	<ul><h4>In the old days, people preferred a big family, the bigger the merrier. Some families bragged about four or even five generations living under one roof. Maybe that's why God gave Jacob four wives. Those wives gave Jacob 12 sons. From them a nation was born. However, Jacob didn't treat his wives equally. Especially, he favored Rachel more than Leah. So, God let Leah conceive first and gave Leah more sons than Jacob's other wives, including Rachel. That showed God was justice and merciful to all who were involved in His plan. So, how do we learn to abide in God's plan?</h4></ul>

	<ul><h4>God could make many covenants with men to give men His blessings, yet if men didn't believe in God, then all is in vain. That's because ever since men sinned, we are under the domain of the knowledge of good and evil and have our own beliefs. The only way to change that is through the Holy Spirit. How do we know that the Holy Spirit could transform us from a self-centered sinner to a cleansed believer?</h4></ul>

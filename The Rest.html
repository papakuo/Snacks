	<ul><h4>We don't have rest or peace if we don't obey God. Even if we tried to obey, we still don't have the rest. As long as we are still living in the flesh of the knowledge of good and evil, then that would be the case. Because the knowledge of the good and evil would constantly struggle in our flesh. So, what's the way out for us?</h4></ul>
